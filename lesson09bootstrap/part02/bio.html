      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This is a brief paragraph introducing myself. My name is Jason Wang.
        Beyond being a dedicated father to two wonderful children, I have a
        myriad of interests that keep me engaged in the ever-evolving world of
        technology and leisure.
      </p>

      <h2>Reason for Taking This Course</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to take this webd168 intermediate HTML and CSS course out of a
        genuine interest in web design. While I have dabbled in web development
        before, I realized that to truly bring my vision to life, I need to hone
        my skills, especially in CSS, which I believe is the art behind the
        science of web development.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Hope to Gain</h2>
      <p>
        From this course, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of advanced CSS
        techniques and best practices. I aim to not only improve the aesthetics
        of my web projects but also ensure they provide an optimal user
        experience. Additionally, I wish to connect with like-minded
        individuals, broadening my network and perspective in the field.
      </p>

      <h3>My Experience with Web Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I had an enriching experience attending a course by Profe Secor, which
          provided me with foundational knowledge in web development.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've also been a part of a web design bootcamp. There, I had the
          opportunity to work on several projects, applying my knowledge and
          learning from real-world challenges.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        In my leisure time, I delve deep into the intricate world of
        cryptocurrencies, fascinated by its potential and complexities. When I'm
        not behind a screen, the ocean's allure often draws me to the seaside
        for a refreshing break.
