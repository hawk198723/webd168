                This is a brief paragraph introducing myself. My name is Jason
                Wang. Beyond being a dedicated father to two wonderful children,
                I have a myriad of interests that keep me engaged in the
                ever-evolving world of technology and leisure.

              <p class="card-text">
                I decided to take this webd168 intermediate HTML and CSS course
                out of a genuine interest in web design. While I have dabbled in
                web development before, I realized that to truly bring my vision
                to life, I need to hone my skills, especially in CSS, which I
                believe is the art behind the science of web development.

              <p class="card-text">
                From this course, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of
                advanced CSS techniques and best practices. I aim to not only
                improve the aesthetics of my web projects but also ensure they
                provide an optimal user experience. Additionally, I wish to
                connect with like-minded individuals, broadening my network and
                perspective in the field.

                <li>
                  I had an enriching experience attending a course by Profe
                  Secor, which provided me with foundational knowledge in web
                  development.

                <li>
                  I've also been a part of a web design bootcamp. There, I had
                  the opportunity to work on several projects, applying my
                  knowledge and learning from real-world challenges.

              <p class="card-text">
                In my leisure time, I delve deep into the intricate world of
                cryptocurrencies, fascinated by its potential and complexities.
                When I'm not behind a screen, the ocean's allure often draws me
                to the seaside for a refreshing break.
